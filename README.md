#Task1 
Uref=28.32m/s
ν=1.67×10−5 m2/s
#Task2
Results of task1&2 is shown in the file [task2u3.12.cas.h5] and [task2u3.12.dat] by Zheng.
The calibration was done by using those parameters.
To meet the requirement, level 10 mesh was employed.
Under the calibration results (velocity of inlet = 3.12m/s, pressure of outlet = -7349Pa), the numerical data from Pitot probe point is close to the experimental value.
